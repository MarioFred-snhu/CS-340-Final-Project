# CS-340-Final-Project
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable software necessitates a modular approach, clear naming conventions, consistent formatting, and meaningful documentation. In this course, the CRUD Python module developed in Project One significantly contributed to the organization of functionality within a reusable class. By decoupling the database logic from the dashboard code in Project Two, I efficiently connected MongoDB to the front-end widgets without duplicating logic. This architectural design facilitated easier debugging and updates, and the same module can be repurposed for future Python applications requiring interaction with a MongoDB database. For instance, it could be adapted for a mobile application backend or expanded to incorporate validation and logging for more sophisticated use cases.

As a computer science student, I approach problem-solving by systematically breaking down challenges into smaller tasks, analyzing requirements, and identifying reusable components. In developing the dashboard, I assessed Grazioso Salvareâ€™s rescue needs, mapped those requirements to specific MongoDB queries, and implemented interactive filters that dynamically responded to those queries. In comparison to previous courses, this project demanded a higher level of integration between backend logic and front-end interactivity. I found the utilization of Dash and data-driven callbacks particularly advantageous. In future client projects, I intend to continue employing a modular CRUD design along with structured callbacks to create flexible, real-time dashboards that are closely aligned with business requirements. Ultimately, projects of this nature demonstrate how computer scientists add substantial value by transforming raw data into actionable tools that enable organizations, such as Grazioso Salvare, to make informed and timely decisions.
